# Orrery Web App - Near-Earth Objects Visualization

## Overview

The **Orrery Web App** is an interactive 3D visualization of the solar system, focusing on Near-Earth Objects (NEOs) such as asteroids and comets. Built using **Three.js** and **Next.js**, this app provides a detailed view of the planets, their orbits, and real-time data about NEOs. The project is part of NASA's app challenge and aims to raise awareness of potential NEOs while offering an educational experience for space enthusiasts.

## Features

- 🌍 **3D Solar System**: A realistic 3D rendering of the solar system including all major planets, their moons, and the Sun.
- 🔭 **Interactive Orrery**: Zoom in/out, rotate, and explore planetary orbits, NEOs, and their positions relative to Earth.
- 🤔 **Guess and Story Game**: It includes a text-based game where you can play a word game as well as a planet guessing game.

## Technologies

- **Three.js**: A powerful JavaScript 3D library used to render the solar system and NEOs in real time.
- **Next.js**: A React-based framework for building performant web applications with server-side rendering and static site generation.
- **React Three Fiber**: A renderer for Three.js that allows for easier integration of 3D content with React.
