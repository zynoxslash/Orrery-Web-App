    description: `
  - The Sun is a yellow dwarf star and a hot ball of gas shining at the heart of our Solar System. Its gravity holds the Solar System together, keeping everything from the largest planets to the smallest particles in orbit. The interactions between the Sun and Earth guide seasons, ocean currents, weather, climate, radiation belts, and auroras.

- With a radius of about 700,000 kilometers, our Sun is not particularly large. Its mass is approximately 333,000 times that of Earth. To fill the Sun, we would need about 1.3 million Earths.

- The Sun’s nearest stellar neighbor, Alpha Centauri, is a triple star system consisting of Proxima Centauri, which is 4.24 light-years away, and Alpha Centauri A and B, which are 4.37 light-years away. A light-year is the distance light travels in one year.

- The part of the Sun we see from Earth, known as the surface, is called the photosphere. The Sun does not have a solid surface as it is a ball of plasma.

- Above the Sun's surface is the thin chromosphere and the vast corona. Here, we observe features like solar prominences, flares, and coronal mass ejections, which are massive bursts of energy and particles that can reach Earth.

- The Sun has no moons but orbits eight planets, at least five dwarf planets, tens of thousands of asteroids, and possibly three trillion comets and icy bodies.

- Various spacecraft, including the Parker Solar Probe, STEREO, Solar Orbiter, SOHO, Solar Dynamics Observatory, Hinode, IRIS, and Wind, are currently studying the Sun.

- About 4.6 billion years ago, when the Solar System first formed, the Sun was surrounded by a disk of gas and dust. Some of this dust still exists today as several rings of dust surrounding the Sun, with planets' orbits influencing the dust's distribution.

- No life can exist on the Sun, but its energy is vital for most life on Earth.

- The temperature in the Sun's core is around 27 million degrees Fahrenheit (15 million degrees Celsius), hot enough to sustain nuclear fusion, creating the immense pressure that prevents it from collapsing.

- The Sun is about 100 times wider than Earth and roughly 10 times wider than the largest planet, Jupiter.

- The Sun rotates around the center of the Milky Way, taking the planets, asteroids, comets, and other objects along with it, moving at an average speed of 450,000 miles per hour (720,000 kilometers per hour). Even at this speed, it takes about 230 million years to complete one orbit around the Milky Way. As it rotates around the galaxy, the Sun also spins on its axis, with a tilt of 7.25 degrees relative to the plane of the planets' orbits. Since the Sun is not solid, different parts rotate at different speeds. At the equator, it completes a rotation roughly every 25 Earth days, while at the poles, it takes about 36 Earth days.

- Measuring a "day" on the Sun is complex. The Sun consists of extremely hot, electrically charged gas called plasma, which rotates at varying speeds in different regions. The Sun completes one rotation at its equator in 25 Earth days and one at its poles in 36 Earth days.

- The Sun's immense mass is held together by gravitational forces, creating high pressure and temperature at its center. It has six regions: the core, the radiative zone, the convective zone, the photosphere (the visible surface), the chromosphere, and the corona, which is the outermost region.

- The energy produced in the core powers the Sun and generates all its heat and light. Energy from the core moves outward through radiation in the radiative zone, bouncing around for about 170,000 years before reaching the convective zone at the top. In the convective zone, which is less than 2 million degrees Celsius, large hot plasma bubbles rise. The Sun's surface temperature is about 5,500 degrees Celsius, which is cooler than the core but still hot enough to melt and vaporize materials like carbon.

- The Sun formed about 4.6 billion years ago from a giant, rotating cloud of gas and dust known as a solar nebula. As the nebula collapsed under its own gravity, it spun faster and flattened into a disk. Most of the material formed the Sun, which accounts for 99.8% of the Solar System's mass, while the remaining material formed the planets and other objects (with the remaining gas and dust blown away by the early solar wind of the young Sun).

- Like all stars, our Sun will eventually exhaust its energy. When it begins to die, it will transform into a red giant, expanding enough to engulf Mercury, Venus, and possibly Earth. Scientists estimate that the Sun has completed just over half of its lifespan and will live for another 5 billion years before becoming a white dwarf.- The Sun is a yellow dwarf star and a hot ball of gas shining at the heart of our Solar System.

    description: `
- Asteroids are small, rock-like celestial bodies orbiting the Sun. While they orbit the Sun like planets, they are much smaller.

- There are many asteroids in our Solar System, with most found in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. Asteroids can also be found in the orbits of planets, moving around the Sun alongside them, including in Earth's orbit.

- Asteroids are remnants from the formation of the Solar System, which occurred about 4.6 billion years ago from the merging of a massive gas and dust cloud. When this happened, many materials gathered at the center to form the Sun, while others formed the planets. However, the materials in the asteroid belt did not have the opportunity to merge into planets.

- No two asteroids are the same in shape and size, as they formed at varying distances from the Sun. They differ in irregular shapes, sizes (some are kilometers wide, while others are as small as pebbles), and composition (metals like nickel and iron, or clay).

- The largest member of the Asteroid Belt, and a dwarf planet, is Ceres, with a diameter of about 950 kilometers. There are over 200 asteroids in the belt that are larger than 100 kilometers in diameter. The number of asteroids over 1 kilometer in diameter is estimated to be between 70,000 and 1.7 million, while smaller asteroids number in the millions.
Although there are many asteroids in the Asteroid Belt, these celestial bodies are spread over a vast area. The distances from the Sun to the inner and outer boundaries of the Asteroid Belt are approximately 2.12 AU and 3.3 AU, respectively (AU - astronomical unit - is the average distance between the Earth and the Sun). This means the width of this region is about 180 million kilometers.

Scientists estimate that the average distance between asteroids in the Asteroid Belt is about 1 million kilometers. Considering that the average distance from the Moon to Earth is 384,400 kilometers, it can be said that the Asteroid Belt is quite a calm region. However, on an astronomical scale, collisions between asteroids occur frequently in this area. The frequency of these collisions varies depending on the size of the asteroids. For example, Vesta, with an average diameter of 525 kilometers, is estimated to have a collision probability with another asteroid larger than 1 kilometer in diameter once every 4.2 million years.

 Jupiter has 79 confirmed moons, the most famous of which are Gaynmede and Europa. 
Jupiter ranks 5th in the Solar System and is the largest planet. Jupiter's mass is twice the mass of all the other planets in the Solar System combined. 
Jupiter's radius is 69.911 km. It is 11 times wider than the Earth.
Jupiter's distance from the Sun is 778 million kilometres. This makes 5.2 au (astronomical distance). 1 astronomical distance is the distance between the Earth and the Sun. 
The rays from the Sun reach Jupiter in 43 minutes. In other words, if that distance were travelled at the speed of light, the journey would take 43 minutes.

It takes Jupiter 12 Earth years to make one complete revolution around the Sun.
Jupiter makes an inclination of only 3 degrees as it revolves around the Sun. This means that Jupiter does not have various seasons like other planets. On Earth, this inclination is 23.5 degrees.

Saturn is not the only planet with rings, but it is certainly the most beautiful. The ring we see is made up of a group of smaller rings.
 These rings are made of ice and rock. Like Jupiter, Saturn is made mostly of hydrogen and helium.
When Galileo Galilei saw Saturn through his telescope in the 1600s, he wasn't sure what he was looking at. At first he thought he was looking at three planets or a planet with ears. 
But now we know that those ears are Saturn's rings.Saturn, like Jupiter, is a gas giant, made up mostly of hydrogen and helium. 
It has a dense atmosphere. Saturn is famous for its rings. This planet has 7 rings with gaps between them.1 day on Saturn lasts 10.7 hours. 1 Saturnian year is equal to 29 Earth years.
Saturn has 53 moons. 29 of which we need to know more about.
Saturn has been known since ancient times because it can be seen without a telescope. With the developing technology, 4 robotic spacecraft have visited Saturn over time.
The ring structure consists of pieces ranging in size from dust grain to apartment size.  These are Pioneer 11, Cassini, Voyager 1 and 2 spacecraft.
Although the ring structure is extremely wide at about 280,000 kilometres across, it is only about 10 metres thick.
It is not as colourful a planet as Jupiter. Although it has an atmosphere with shades of yellow, brown and grey, it is not a planet with prominent large storm structures (or spots).
. Although it has bands like Jupiter, there are no colour differences that would allow us to easily distinguish these bands from each other.
The planet's atmosphere (similar to that of Jupiter) is found to be composed mainly of hydrogen and helium (96.3% hydrogen, 3.2% helium), with small amounts of methane (0.5%) and ammonia (0.01%). 
As on Jupiter, the zero point (i.e. the reference point) is considered to be the top of the troposphere. Saturn's clouds are classified into three basic groups. 
These are ammonium ices, ammonium hydrosulphide ices and water ices.

 It rotates in the opposite direction to most other planets. Uranus has 13 rings. 
Uranus is an ice giant, not a gas giant. It consists mostly of fluid icy material on a solid core. The dense atmosphere of Uranus

Uranus is the only planet that rotates sideways. Unlike the Earth and other planets, it rotates around itself in the opposite direction (from east to west).
Uranus has 27 known satellites. Uranus' satellites are divided into 3 different groups. Of these, 13 are inner satellites, 5 are main satellites and the remaining 9 are irregular satellites. 
It was discovered in 1781 by William Herschel in Great Britain. This planet has only been visited by the Voyager 2 spacecraft.
Uranus has moved 1 degree west since its discovery. However, its average distance from the Sun is still considered to be 2.9 kilometres. 
Weighing 8.682x1025 kg, Uranus is 14.5 times larger than Earth, but has the lowest mass among the other gas giants in the Solar System (Jupiter, Saturn and Neptune).
 planet. However, with a diameter of 50,724 kilometres, Uranus is slightly larger than Neptune and about 4 times larger than the Earth. 
Uranus is the third largest planet in the Solar System. Uranus has a radius of 25,362 kilometres and a volume 63 times larger than Earth. This means that we can fit 63 Earths inside Uranus.
The surface area of Uranus is 8.1x109 km2. So; if we cover the surface of Uranus with the surface area of the Earth, we will need to use about 16 Earths.
With a density of 1.27 g/cm3, Uranus is the second planet with the lowest density among the planets in the Solar System. In this ranking, Saturn has the lowest density with 0.7 g/cm3.
 When we look at this value, it shows that Uranus is primarily covered with various ices such as water, ammonia and methane.
A day on Uranus lasts exactly 17 hours and 14 minutes.
 In addition, Uranus completes one full revolution around the Sun at a speed of 24,607 km/h in approximately 84 Earth years.
 This means that every 84 years we spend on Earth is equivalent to 1 year for an imaginary person living on Uranus. A year on Uranus contains 31,000 days.
Although the length of the day is shorter than on Earth, there is a significant difference in the length of the year. This is because Uranus is very long compared to Earth. 
Uranus revolves around itself more rapidly, and at the same time a full revolution around the Sun takes much longer.
Uranus has an axis tilt of about 98o, meaning that it orbits almost sideways.
 The first explanation for this is that a celestial body about the size of two Earths crashed into the surface of Uranus long ago.
 is a change in the planet's axis tilt.
Simulations carried out in 2011 showed that the axis tilt of Uranus changed again as a result of the impact of smaller but more numerous celestial bodies instead of a large celestial body. 
and this could explain why the moons of Uranus have the same obliquity. In other words, Uranus may have been ‘attacked’ by many large and small objects, rather than being hit by a single one.
 and the average tilt of this large number of bodies may have caused not only Uranus but also its other moons to tilt roughly equally. While this is not a final explanation, it is a possible 
explanation.
The diameter of the core of Uranus is 20 per cent of its total diameter, and the mass of its core is 0.55 of the total mass of the Earth. The mass of the Uranian mantle is 13.4 Earth masses. 
The density of the core of Uranus is 9 g/cm3. It has a pressure of about 8 million bar at its centre and is about 4726 degrees Celsius. 
In 986, the Voyager 2 spacecraft sent us some information about the planet's climate as it travelled around Uranus. Thanks to this information, we learnt that there are 10 different types of clouds all over the planet.
 However, we were not able to find out why the internal temperature of Uranus is lower than that of other gas giants. We were able to fill this gap with the help of the Hubble Space Telescope.
 We have learnt that storms as big as Uranus can occur, even twice the size of the United States in some regions. 
In 2006, during research on Uranus, a huge black cloud was observed on the planet. These gigantic storm clouds were seen to be two-thirds the size of America. The average temperature of these black clouds was -193 degrees Celsius and the winds of the storm were blowing in the opposite direction of the planet at 900 kilometres per hour.

    description: `
Neptune, the last planet in our Solar System, is dark, cold and very windy. Its distance to the Sun is 30 times greater than the Earth's distance to the Sun. Neptune is very similar to Uranus. 
 It consists of dense water vapour, ammonia and methane gas on a solid Earth-sized centre. Its atmosphere consists of hydrogen, helium and methane. 
Just like Uranus, it is methane that gives Neptune its blue colour. Neptune has 6 rings, but it is very difficult to see them.
Neptune, like Uranus, is an ice giant and structurally similar to a gas giant. It consists of dense water vapour, ammonia and methane gas over a solid Earth-sized core. 
It has a dense, windy atmosphere. A day on Neptune lasts 16 hours. One revolution around the Sun is equal to 165 Earth years.
Neptune has 13 moons and one satellite awaiting confirmation.Neptune was discovered in 1846 by Urbain Le Verrier, John Couch Adams and Johann Galle. 
It has only been visited by the Voyager 2 spacecraft.Neptune is a cold and dark ice giant with fast and strong winds.
Within the Solar System, planets beyond the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter are called exoplanets, and Neptune is considered an exoplanet in this sense.
 Neptune ranks fourth among the exoplanets. Although it is a large planet, its satellites are small.
Neptune completed its first orbit after its discovery in 2011. The next round of its 165-year orbit will be completed in 2176. 
NASA's Voyager 2 spacecraft was the first spacecraft sent into space to visit Neptune.
Neptune is a gas giant; that is, it is not a rocky planet like the Earth, but is composed entirely of gas. The environment on Neptune is therefore characterised by incredibly high pressure and temperature.
 In addition, the gases that make up Neptune are not organic in nature, making Neptune an unsuitable habitat for life as we know it. 
In the formation of Neptune, the majority of the planet's mass (80 per cent or more) is concentrated around a small nucleus. 
ice, methane and ammonia. This core is solid, but not rocky, and its mass is about the same as that of Earth. 
In contrast to the blue-green colour of its neighbour Uranus, Neptune has a more vivid and finger blue atmospheric structure. What gives Neptune its intense blue colour is unknown.
 is thought to be a component.
Neptune is about four times wider than Earth, with a radius of 24,622 kilometres: Earth is about the size of a coin, 
Neptune would be about the size of a baseball. On average, Neptune is 4.5 billion kilometres (30 astronomical units) from the Sun. 1 astronomical unit (abbreviated as AU), 
It is the distance from the Sun to the Earth, and the journey from the Sun to Neptune takes 4 hours.
Neptune's axis of rotation is similar to the axis tilt of Mars and Earth. It is also inclined 28 degrees relative to the plane of its orbit around the Sun.
 For this reason, seasons are experienced on Neptune as on Earth. However, seasonal transitions on Neptune are much longer. 
(each of the four seasons lasting more than 40 years in total).
Neptune's gravitational force is about 27 times stronger than Earth's. The major axis of Neptune's magnetosphere is tilted about 47 degrees compared to the axis of rotation. 
Like Uranus, whose magnetic axis is tilted approximately 60 degrees from the axis of rotation, Neptune's magnetic field creates a formal change in the planetary structure with each rotation due to this alignment. 
Neptune is the planet with the highest wind density in the Solar System. Although it is quite far from the Sun and therefore has relatively low energy input, 
Neptune's winds are three times stronger than Jupiter's and nine times stronger than Earth's. Neptune's winds blow clouds of frozen methane across the planet at over 2,000 kilometres per hour.
 faster than the Earth's winds. Even the strongest winds on Earth only reach about 400 kilometres per hour. 
Shortly after the discovery of Neptune, astronomer William Lassell detected a faint ring around the planet while observing it.
Later, the Vogayer 2 spacecraft, which was sent to study the outer Solar System planets, proved in August 1989 that there was a ring system around Neptune. 
Neptune has 4 rings. It is known that Neptune's rings are dark and faint compared to Saturn. These rings are approximately 60,000 km from the planet's surface. 
at a distance, dark in colour and thin in structure. The rings completely encircle the planet, yet they appear fragmented.
